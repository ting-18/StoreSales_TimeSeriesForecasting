# StoreSales_TimeSeriesForecasting

In this project, I embark on a journey to develop accurate forecasting models for store sales using time series analysis techniques and machine learning models. Effective sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to optimize inventory management, anticipate customer demands, and make informed decisions to drive profitability.

By leveraging 3 million historical sales records, my objective is to build robust predictive models capable of accurately predicting bi-weekly future sales for 33 product families across 54 stores.

Throughout this project, I explore my efforts in data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluating store sales data. These endeavors are aimed at empowering businesses with actionable insights, enabling them to stay ahead of market dynamics and make informed decisions.
